# CSCI 4830 - HW2

Hi this is my repo for my code for Homework 2 of Mathematical & Computational Modeling of Infectious Diseases.
I worked in the Juypter Notebook (.ipynb) file but included a .py file version as well. I also included a stand alone .py version of the code for problem 1c though I used it in context within my Juypter Notebook.
